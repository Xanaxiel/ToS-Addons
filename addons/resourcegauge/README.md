# ~~Resource Gauge~~ Discontinued - better alternatives are Weizlogy's [skillitemcounter](http://www.weizlogy.gq/tos/addon/skillitemcounter/) for resource management, [staminigauge](http://www.weizlogy.gq/tos/addon/staminagauge/) for stamina

**Shows certain resources that is useful to be monitored on your character specially for specific classes. (Could still be further expanded)**

* **Pet stamina while mounted**
* **Also includes Necromancer's Corpses, as well as Wugushi's Poison Pots** - __*These still need more in-depth testing, please post an issue when you encounter one*__
